## To-Do

Work in Progress:

The fitness tracker application features a sophisticated ChatGPT based chatbot that empowers users to plan their future workouts. It intelligently addresses user queries, taking into account various personalized factors such as injuries, experience level, and daily condition.

To enhance the user experience, the application allows users to save their chat history, enabling them to strategically plan their future workouts based on previous activities, weather conditions, location, and other relevant parameters.

Moreover, considering the value of shared knowledge and experience, it would be advantageous to incorporate a dedicated review section for each workout/exercise. This functionality would enable users to gain insights and draw inspiration from others' experiences, further enhancing their own workout routines.

While the application is still under development, I am enthusiastic about receiving suggestions and feedback to refine and enhance its capabilities. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at dhk2431@gmail.com.
